## Description
**dna-crypter** is a program that encodes ASCII text as a DNA sequence, and decodes vice versa. It was built using React.

## For developers
If you want to implement your own encryption/decryption function, clone this respository. 

To run the code, use `npm start`. Note, you might need to run`npm install` first.

To implement your own function, navigate to `./src/dnacrypter.js` and edit the `encode()` and `decode()` functions.

Happy encrypting!
